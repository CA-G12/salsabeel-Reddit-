# Craft
## Description :
Craft is a social network for posting photos. Kraft's working principle is a little different from other social media. Each Kraft subscriber can post pictures and write comments on other people’s photos. Anyone can view the posts without subscribing to the site, while only subscribers can write comments and vote on the post. This site makes it easy for people to share their work, products, projects, or even their ideas.
